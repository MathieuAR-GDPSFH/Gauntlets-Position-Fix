# Gauntlets Position Fix
Fixes the positioning for Gauntlet entries if too few are displayed.


As of 2.2, the way Gauntlets are displayed has changed. That change doesn't have a visual affect in vanilla Geometry Dash, but GDPSs with very few Gauntlets will have their Gauntlet stuck on the next page unless they make a full page of gauntlets.

This mod aims to fix just that by offsetting the first page of the Gauntlets.
